However, search engines today focus on suggesting mainly reformulations and lexical variants of the query mined from query logs. In this demonstration, we show a system that can suggest related topics for a query based on the top search results for the query. It can help users in exploring the topics related to their information need. The topic suggestion system can be integrated with any search engine or it can be easily installed on the client machine as a browser plugin.}},

    abstract = {{Users frequently modify a previous search query in hope of retrieving better results. These modifications are called query reformulations or query refinements. Existing research has studied how web search engines can propose reformulations, but has given less attention to how people perform query reformulations. In this paper, we aim to better understand how web searchers refine queries and form a theoretical foundation for query reformulation. We study users' reformulation strategies in the context of the AOL query logs. We create a taxonomy of query refinement strategies and build a high precision rule-based classifier to detect each type of reformulation. Effectiveness of reformulations is measured using user click behavior. Most reformulation strategies result in some benefit to the user. Certain strategies like add/remove words, word substitution, acronym expansion, and spelling correction are more likely to cause clicks, especially on higher ranked results. In contrast, users often click the same result as their previous query or select no results when forming acronyms and reordering words. Perhaps the most surprising finding is that some reformulations are better suited to helping users when the current results are already fruitful, while other reformulations are more effective when the results are lacking. Our findings inform the design of applications that can assist searchers; examples are described in this paper.}},

    abstract = {{Web query classification (QC) aims to classify Web users' queries, which are often short and ambiguous, into a set of target categories. QC has many applications including page ranking in Web search, targeted advertisement in response to queries, and personalization. In this paper, we present a novel approach for QC that outperforms the winning solution of the ACM KDDCUP 2005 competition, whose objective is to classify 800,000 real user queries. In our approach, we first build a bridging classifier on an intermediate taxonomy in an offline mode. This classifier is then used in an online mode to map user queries to the target categories via the above intermediate taxonomy. A major innovation is that by leveraging the similarity distribution over the intermediate taxonomy, we do not need to retrain a new classifier for each new set of target categories, and therefore the bridging classifier needs to be trained only once. In addition, we introduce category selection as a new method for narrowing down the scope of the intermediate taxonomy based on which we classify the queries. Category selection can improve both efficiency and effectiveness of the online classification. By combining our algorithm with the winning solution of KDDCUP 2005, we made an improvement by 9.7\% and 3.8\% in terms of precision and F1 respectively compared with the best results of KDDCUP 2005.}},

    abstract = {{User search query logs have proven to be very useful, but have vast potential for misuse. Several incidents have shown that simple removal of identifiers is insufficient to protect the identity of users. Publishing such inadequately anonymized data can cause severe breach of privacy. While significant effort has been expended on coming up with anonymity models and techniques for microdata, there is little corresponding work for query log data. Query logs are different in several important aspects, such as the diversity of queries and the causes of privacy breach. This necessitates the need to design privacy models and techniques specific to this environment. This paper takes a first cut at tackling this challenge. Our main contribution is to define effective anonymization models for query log data along with proposing techniques to achieve such anonymization. We analyze the inherent utility and privacy tradeoff, and experimentally validate the performance of our techniques.}},
