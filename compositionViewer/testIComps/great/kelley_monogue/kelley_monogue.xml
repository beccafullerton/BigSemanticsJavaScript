For many years security guards were poorly chosen and poorly trained (if at all), partly because security guard companies who contracted with clients in private industry were paid very little for their security guard services. For the most part, contracts were awarded to security guard companies through a competition process and the final selection was often made based on cost rather than the experience or professionalism of the security guard company. That changed drastically on September 11, 2001 when radical Islamic terrorists attacked the United States. The event moved corporate threat concerns to the top of the priority list for most security guard contracts started being awarded based on professionalism. More money was invested in security so more money became available for training of security guards. The term &#39;security professional&#39; began to surface and large private security companies like Blackwater, USA began offering training services for the private security industry that approached the level of training provided by the military. Security guard companies began paying enough to attract people with significant backgrounds in law enforcement and the military, often is special operations. Training became a big priority throughout the industry and training books authored by experienced security professionals like THE ROLE OF THE SECURITY OFFICER suddenly began appearing on the scene. The trend for more professional, well-trained security officers grew and spread around the world and continues to be improved and fine-tuned to this day. Security officers are no longer considered &#39;bottom feeders&#39; by military and police officers. Highly-paid private security operatives are now being deployed around the world to augment military operations in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and this trend is likely to continue due to shortages in personnel in today&#39;s mostly volunteer military."></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="Any person who conducts a business or is employed in a security-related field within Australia is required to be licensed.

The first truly popular spa was Saratoga Springs, which, by 1815, had two large, four-story, Greek revival hotels. It grew rapidly, and by 1821 it had at least five hundred rooms for accommodation. Its relative proximity to New York city and access to the country&#39;s most developed steamboat lines meant that by the mid-1820s the spa became the country&#39;s most popular tourist destination, serving both the country&#39;s elite and a more middle-class audience.[15][16] Although spa activity had been central to Saratoga in the 1810s, by the 1820s the resort had hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. The Union Hotel (first built in 1803 but steadily expanded over the coming decades) had its own esplanade, and by the 1820s had its own fountain and formal landscaping, but with only two small bathhouses.

The first truly popular spa was Saratoga Springs, which, by 1815, had two large, four-story, Greek revival hotels. It grew rapidly, and by 1821 it had at least five hundred rooms for accommodation. Its relative proximity to New York city and access to the country&#39;s most developed steamboat lines meant that by the mid-1820s the spa became the country&#39;s most popular tourist destination, serving both the country&#39;s elite and a more middle-class audience.[15][16] Although spa activity had been central to Saratoga in the 1810s, by the 1820s the resort had hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. The Union Hotel (first built in 1803 but steadily expanded over the coming decades) had its own esplanade, and by the 1820s had its own fountain and formal landscaping, but with only two small bathhouses.

It was formed in 1844 when there was concern over drownings in the River Medway. Rescuers would often die in the water because they could usually not swim to safety themselves. The club used to swim in the river and would hold races, diving competitions and water polo matches in the Medway. The South East Gazette July 1844 reported an aquatic breakfast party. Coffee and biscuits were served on a floating raft in the river, the coffee was kept hot over a fire and club members had to tread water and drink coffee at the same time. The last swimmers managed to overturn the raft to the amusement of the 150 spectators!

They raise temperature of a pool by around 20 &#176;Fahrenheit, or 11 &#176;Celsius, after being on the pool for a week. Bubble covers are typically applied and removed by being rolled up on a device fitted to one side of the pool (see illustration).

They established public baths and showers within their gymnasium complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene. Greek mythology specified that certain natural springs or tidal pools were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods for healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The Spartans developed a primitive vapor bath. At Serangeum, an early Greek balneum (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers&#39; clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below.

The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers.[7]"><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="rheumatoid arthritis" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis" target_title="Rheumatoid arthritis"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, 140-degree hot air for 20 minutes, spent another ten minutes in a room with 150-degree temperature, partook of a 154-degree vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm &#34;Sprudel&#34; room pool. This shallow pool&#39;s bottom contained an 8-inch (200&#160;mm) layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program.[7]"></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight-seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient&#39;s expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health.[7] In Germany, the tradition survives to the present day. &#39;Taking a cure&#39; (http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kur) at a spa is covered by both public and private health care insurance, as mandated by federal legislation. Typically, a doctor prescribes a few weeks stay at a mineral spring or other natural setting where a patient&#39;s condition will be treated with healing spring waters and natural therapies."></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s, British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were Bath, Yellow, and Bristol Springs in Pennsylvania; and Warm Springs, Hot Springs, and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia (now in West Virginia) in Virginia.[7] In the last decade of the 1700s, New York spas were beginning to be frequented by intrepid travelers, most notably Ballston Spa.

The first truly popular spa was Saratoga Springs, which, by 1815, had two large, four-story, Greek revival hotels. It grew rapidly, and by 1821 it had at least five hundred rooms for accommodation. Its relative proximity to New York city and access to the country&#39;s most developed steamboat lines meant that by the mid-1820s the spa became the country&#39;s most popular tourist destination, serving both the country&#39;s elite and a more middle-class audience.[15][16] Although spa activity had been central to Saratoga in the 1810s, by the 1820s the resort had hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. The Union Hotel (first built in 1803 but steadily expanded over the coming decades) had its own esplanade, and by the 1820s had its own fountain and formal landscaping, but with only two small bathhouses. As the resort developed as a tourist destination mineral bathhouses became auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort, although the drinking of mineral water was at least followed as a pro-forma activity by most in attendance, despite nightly dinners that were elaborate and extensive. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was a complex social life and a cultural cachet. However, the wider audience it garnered by the late 1820s began to take some of the bloom off the resort, and in the mid-1830s, as a successful bid to revive itself, it turned to horse racing.[7][17]"><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="American Revolution" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution" target_title="American Revolution"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Saratoga Springs" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs" target_title="Saratoga Springs"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Greek revival" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_revival" target_title="Greek revival"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="By the mid 1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building.[7]"></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing.[7][18][19]"></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="During the last half of the 19th century, western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts &#8212; from the Mississippi River to the West Coast.

The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel.

Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowned resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910, the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses &#8212; Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt &#8212; a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the Simon Baruch Research Institute. Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. Saratoga Spa State Park&#39;s Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a 1,200-acre (4.9&#160;km2) natural park that had 18 miles (29&#160;km) of bridle paths, &#34;with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads. Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping&#34;. Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history.

They typically have a handrail on the outer side only, and on the inner side just the central pole. A squared spiral stair assumes a square stairwell and expands the steps and railing to a square, resulting in unequal steps (larger where they extend into a corner of the square). A pure spiral assumes a circular stairwell and the steps and handrail are equal and positioned screw-symmetrically. A tight spiral stair with a central pole is very space efficient in the use of floor area. Spiral stairs have the disadvantage of being very steep. Unless the central column is very large, the circumference of the circle at the walk line will be small enough that it will be impossible to maintain a normal tread depth and a normal rise height without compromising headroom before reaching the upper floor. To maintain headroom most spiral stairs have very high rises and a very short going.

The road going Targa was equipped with a removable roof panel and a removable plastic rear window (although a fixed glass version was offered alongside from 1968)."><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Targa" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targa_top" target_title="Targa top"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="stainless steel" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel" target_title="Stainless steel"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="National Highway Traffic Safety Administration" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration" target_title="National Highway Traffic Safety Administration"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="convertibles" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible" target_title="Convertible"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Targa Florio" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targa_Florio" target_title="Targa Florio"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Sicily" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily" target_title="Sicily"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="The 110&#160;PS (81&#160;kW; 108&#160;hp) 911T was also launched in 1967 and effectively replaced the 912.

This was in part due to the 997&#39;s VTG (variable turbine geometry), which essentially combines the low-rev boost and quick responses of a small turbocharger with the high-rev power of a larger turbocharger. As well as producing more power and flexibility, the new turbocharger improved fuel consumption over the 996 Turbo. With these performance upgrades, it accelerates to 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) in 3.7&#160;seconds (with the manual transmission) and reaches a top speed of 310&#160;km/h (193&#160;mph).

Featuring PTM (Porsche Traction Management) the new system incorporates a clutch-based system which varies the amount of torque to the wheels to avoid tyre slippage. This, according to Porsche, aids traction and the handling by redirecting the torque to control oversteer or understeer, thus resulting in far more neutral handling, as well as greatly improved performance in all weather conditions (as opposed to older AWD system which gave the Turbo stability under hard acceleration). However, in the facelifted 911 Turbo, launched in August 2009,[20] the PTM system has now been tweaked to give more a more rearward power bias. The new 911 Turbo also has paddle shifters for the PDK double-clutch gearbox for the first time.[20] The new 911 turbo uses a completely different engine. The previous water-cooled turbos (996 and 997) measured 3600cc and were based on the so-called Mezger motor that powered numerous race cars. The new engine measures 3800cc and was first developed for the new carrera that was launched in 2008. The variable-vane twin turbochargers have also been extensively reworked to increase responsiveness, and the intercooler and fuel system have been uprated. It develops 493&#160;bhp which is 20&#160;bhp more than the previous model.[20] The steering wheel also houses a display showing when Sport, Sport Plus and launch control have been selected through the optional Sport Chrono package.[20] Porsche claims the new 911 turbo will go from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds and reach a top-speed of 312 km/h (194 mph). However, several tests done by Auto-Magazines and unpartial testers have revealed that the 0&#8211;100 km/h acceleration-time is generally as low as 2.9 seconds."><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="all-wheel-drive" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel-drive" target_title="All-wheel-drive"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Porsche Cayenne" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Cayenne" target_title="Porsche Cayenne"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="Styling wise, as with the 996 Turbo the car featured more distinctive styling cues over the Carreras, one of the more distinctive elements the front LED driving/parking/indicator lights mounted on a horizontal bar across the air intakes.

The temporary dam was blown up to restore water flow.[17]"><source_doc><wikipedia_page simpl:ref="18657610"/></source_doc></text_clipping><text_clipping context="Before the late 20th century the northeastern end of the Horseshoe Falls was in the United States, flowing around the Terrapin Rocks, which was once connected to Goat Island by a series of bridges.

The consensus honoree for the first description is the Belgian missionary Louis Hennepin, who observed and described the falls in 1677, earlier than Kalm, after traveling with the explorer Ren&#233; Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle, thus bringing the falls to the attention of Europeans. Further complicating matters, there is credible evidence that the French Jesuit Reverend Paul Ragueneau visited the falls some 35 years before Hennepin&#39;s visit, while working among the Huron First Nation in Canada.

In March 1848, ice blockage caused the falls to stop; no water (or at best a trickle) fell for as much as 40 hours. Waterwheels stopped, mills and factories simply shut down for having no power.[16] Later that year demand for passage over the Niagara River led to the building of a footbridge and then Charles Ellet&#39;s Niagara Suspension Bridge. This was supplanted by German-born John Augustus Roebling&#39;s Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge in 1855. After the American Civil War, the New York Central railroad publicized Niagara Falls as a focus of pleasure and honeymoon visits. With increased railroad traffic, in 1886, Leffert Buck replaced Roebling&#39;s wood and stone bridge with the predominantly steel bridge that still carries trains over the Niagara River today. The first steel archway bridge near the falls was completed in 1897. Known today as the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge, it carries vehicles, trains, and pedestrians between Canada (through Canadian Customs Border Control) and the U.S.A. just below the falls.

In 1853, the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Mining Company was chartered, which eventually constructed the canals which would be used to generate electricity. In 1881, under the leadership of Jacob Schoellkopf, Niagara River&#39;s first hydroelectric generating station was built.

When electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units can operate as pumps to transport water from the lower bay back up to the plant&#39;s reservoir, allowing this water to be used again during the daytime when electricity use peaks. During peak electrical demand, the same Lewiston pumps are reversed and actually become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant.[23]"><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Lewiston" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lewiston_Power_Plant&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target_title="Lewiston Power Plant (page does not exist)"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Robert Moses" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses_Niagara_Power_Plant" target_title="Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="hydroelectric" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric" target_title="Hydroelectric"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="turbines" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbines" target_title="Turbines"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="mechanical energy" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_energy" target_title="Mechanical energy"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="electrical energy" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity" target_title="Electricity"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="reservoir" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir" target_title="Reservoir"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="During tourist season, water usage by the power plant is limited by a treaty signed by the U.S. and Canada in 1950 to preserve this natural attraction.

The stunt was conceived by Peter DeBenardi, who wanted to discourage youth from following in his path of addictive drug use. Peter was also trying to leave a legacy and discourage his son Kyle Lahey DeBernardi (age 2) from using addictive drugs. Peter DeBernardi had initially planned to have a different passenger. However, Peter&#39;s original partner backed out, and Peter was forced to look for an alternative. Jeffery Petkovich agreed to attempt the stunt with him. Peter claims he spent an estimated $30,000 making his barrel, made of steel and fiberglass, which had harnesses, reinforcing steel bands, and viewing ports. Peter&#39;s barrel also had a radio for music and news reports, rudders to help steer the barrel through the falls, oxygen, and a well-protected video camera to record the journey over the edge.
