Duluth, Minnesota, at its peak, had as many as 14 public saunas.[7] Indeed, among Finnish farms in Great Lakes &#34;sauna country&#34;, the cultural geographer Matti Kaups, found that 90% had sauna structures-more even than the farms in Finland. Elsewhere, sauna facilities are normally provided at health clubs and at hotels, but there is no tradition or ritual to their use, and many people fail to appreciate their benefits. To avoid liability, many saunas operate at only moderate temperatures and do not allow pouring water on the rocks. A wider range of sauna etiquette is usually acceptable in the United States compared to other countries, with the exception that most mixed-sex saunas usually require some clothing such as a bathing suit to be worn. These are uncommon, however, as most saunas are either small private rooms or in the changing rooms of health clubs or gyms. There are few restrictions and their use is casual; bathers may enter and exit the sauna as they please, be it nude, with a towel, dripping wet in swimsuits or even in workout clothes (the latter being very unusual). Like many aspects of US culture, there are few prescribed conventions and the bather should remain astute to &#34;read&#34; the specific family or community&#39;s expectations. Besides the Finnish Americans, the older generation of Korean-Americans still uses the saunas as it is available to them. Sauna societies are beginning to emerge in colleges across America, with the first one being formed at Gustavus Adolphus College."><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="United States" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target_title="United States"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Upper Peninsula" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan" target_title="Upper Peninsula of Michigan"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Michigan" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" target_title="Michigan"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Minnesota" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota" target_title="Minnesota"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Wisconsin" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin" target_title="Wisconsin"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Iowa" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa" target_title="Iowa"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Finnish Americans" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_American" target_title="Finnish American"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Gustavus Adolphus College" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Adolphus_College" target_title="Gustavus Adolphus College"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="The Sweat lodge, used by many native North Americans as a form of ritual cleansing, is a notable example of an indigenous tradition with many similarities to the Finnish Sauna, Russian Banya or Swedish Bastu.

A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues to keep up with the sea level, forming a central lagoon. Barrier reefs and atolls do not usually form complete circles, but are broken in places by storms.

By 13,000 years ago, sea level had risen to 60 m (200 ft) lower than at present, and many hills of the coastal plains had become continental islands. As the sea level rise continued, water topped most of the continental islands. The corals could then overgrow the hills, forming the present cays and reefs. Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not changed significantly in the last 6,000 years,[12] and the age of the modern living reef structure is estimated to be between 6,000 and 8,000 years.[13] Although the Great Barrier Reef formed along a continental shelf, and not around a volcanic island, Darwin&#39;s principles apply.

The University of Hawaii has come up with a Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP) to help relocate and restore coral reefs in Hawaii.

There were also many areas of coral reef patches in the channel that has been damaged from past dredging in the channel. Dredging covers the existing corals with sand, and their larvae cannot build and thrive on sand, they can only build on to existing reefs. Because of this, the University of Hawaii decided to relocate some of the coral reef to a different transplant site. They transplanted them with the help of the United States Army Divers, to a relocation site relatively close to the channel. What they observed was that very little, if any, damage occurred to any of the colonies while they were being transported, and no mortality of coral reefs has been observed on the new transplant site, but they will be continuing to monitor the new transplant site to see how potential environmental impacts (i.e. ocean acidification) will harm the overall reef mortality rate. What they found while trying to attach the coral to the new transplant site was that the coral that was placed on hard rock is growing considerably well, and there&#8217;s even coral growth on the wires that attached the transplant corals to the transplant site. This gives new hope to future research on coral reef transplant sites. As a result of this coral restoration project, no environmental effects were seen from the transplantation process, no recreational activities were decreased, and no scenic areas were impacted by the project.

It has sharp dorsal spines that penetrate human&#10;skin and cause sickness. Normally it occurs at low density and is nocturnal.&#10;In the 1960s, population explosions were found all over the Indo-Pacific&#10;and the starfish were moving in large numbers during the day. Instead of&#10;being of minor impact, they were now major predators on the reef. In Guam,&#10;for example, over 90% of the corals were killed. The explanation of the&#10;origin of the outbreaks is still very controversial. Charles Birkland suggested&#10;that they were related to storms that could wash out nutrients from atolls,&#10;which stimulated phytoplankton grown, which, in turn, increased the survival&#10;of starfish planktotrophic larvae. Others have argued that larval starvation&#10;is not a limiting factor in larval survival. It was also argued that typhoons&#10;and other storms killed corals, causing starvation among the starfish and&#10;a switch to roving in aggregations in search of food."><source_doc><compound_document simpl:ref="26464827"/></source_doc></text_clipping><text_clipping text="&#10; Species of the carnivorous gastropod Cyphoma occur in the Caribbean.&#10;They are often carnivores on octocorals, such as the sea fan, Gorgonia&#10;ventalina , shown at left. They leave a characteristic grazing trail&#10;of dead coral tissue. In the Carribean, Cyphoma gibbosum are notable&#10;for being preda- tors of the gorgonian Plexaura homomalla , which&#10;has very high concentrations of secondary compounds that deter many other&#10;species of predators. The snail consumes the tissue, and has high concentrations&#10;of some detoxifying compounds. C. gibbosum is a generalist and preys&#10;on a number of different prey species, each of which is armed with differing&#10;anti-predator compounds. Catherine Van Alstyne and Nancy Targett showed&#10;that the sea fan pictured at left harbors compounds that strongly reduce&#10;the feeding rate of C. gibbosum , but obviously do not stop predation&#10;completely."><source_doc><compound_document simpl:ref="26464827"/></source_doc></text_clipping><text_clipping text="&#10; An atoll is a ring- or horseshoe-shaped group of islands, surrounding&#10;a lagoon. Coral reefs line the inner and outer parts of the island. Darwin&#10;hypothesized that the earth&#39;s crust was slowly sinking, and that corals&#10;were growing upward and keeping up with the overal sinking rate. At first,&#10;a submarine volcano might be jutting out into the sea, but sinking led to&#10;the ring of coral reefs around the volcano to grow upwards and form the&#10;islands. While most agreed with this hypothesis, the geologist Harry Ladd&#10;confirmed it by leading a drilling team to this region. The team drilled&#10;through hundreds of meters of coral reef rock before reaching volcanic rock&#10;below of Eocene age."><source_doc><compound_document simpl:ref="26464827"/></source_doc></text_clipping><text_clipping text="&#10; The reef is topographically complex. Much like a rain forest, it has&#10;many strata and areas of strong shade, cast by the overtowering coral colonies.&#10;Because of the complexity, thousands of species of fish and invertebrates&#10;live in association with reefs, which are by far our richest marine habitats.&#10;In Caribbean reefs, for example, several hundred species of colonial invertebrates&#10;can be found living on the undersides of platy corals. It is not unusual&#10;for a reef to have several hundred species of snails, sixty species of corals,&#10;and several hundred species of fish. Of all ocean habitats, reefs seem to&#10;have the greatest development of complex symbiotic associations."><source_doc><compound_document simpl:ref="26464827"/></source_doc></text_clipping><text_clipping text="&#10; Deep sites greater than 75-100 m cannot be studied effectively by&#10;surface-originated SCUBA diving.

Stalked crinoids are suspension feeders with an umbrella-like&#10;array of arms, which are festooned with tube-feet. Smaller zooplankton are&#10;captured by tube feet and transferred on ciliated tracts to the mouth. The&#10;body is connected to the substratum by means of a stalk, which consists&#10;of a stack of calcium carbonate plates. Stalked crinoids were very common&#10;in Paleozoic seas, but they are rather rare today."><source_doc><compound_document simpl:ref="26464827"/></source_doc></text_clipping></clippings></compound_document></source_doc><media><image location="http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/marinebio/cr_13.jpg" width="400" height="315" local_location="Ideal Vacation-images/-1206941563.png" simpl:id="22108593"><clippings><image_clipping simpl:ref="26753980"/></clippings></image></media></image_clipping><image_clipping caption="Turtle!!!! - sea-life photo" simpl:id="20783793"><source_doc><compound_document location="http://www.fanpop.com/spots/sea-life/images/2059068/title/turtle-photo" simpl:id="1307084"><title>Turtle!!!! - Sea Life Photo (2059068) - Fanpop</title><clippings><clipping mm_name="clippings"></clipping><image_clipping simpl:ref="20783793"/></clippings></compound_document></source_doc><media><image location="http://images1.fanpop.com/images/photos/2000000/Turtle-sea-life-2059068-672-554.jpg" width="500" height="412" local_location="Ideal Vacation-images/1073443185.png" simpl:id="32096145"><clippings><image_clipping simpl:ref="20783793"/><image_clipping xpath="/img/img/img/img/img/img/img/img/img/img/img" caption="Turtle!!!! - sea-life photo"><source_doc><compound_document simpl:ref="1307084"/></source_doc><outlink><image simpl:ref="32096145"/></outlink><media><image simpl:ref="32096145"/></media></image_clipping><image_clipping><source_doc><compound_document simpl:ref="1307084"/></source_doc><media><image simpl:ref="32096145"/></media></image_clipping><image_clipping><source_doc><compound_document simpl:ref="1307084"/></source_doc><media><image simpl:ref="32096145"/></media></image_clipping><image_clipping><source_doc><compound_document simpl:ref="1307084"/></source_doc><media><image simpl:ref="32096145"/></media></image_clipping></clippings></image></media></image_clipping><image_clipping caption="Rafting Rio Balsa half day class 2 &amp; 3 Arenal Volcano Tour" simpl:id="826322"><source_doc><compound_document mm_name="html" location="http://www.samara-tours.com/arenal_volcano_tours/rafting_rio_balsa.html" page_structure="content_page" simpl:id="4441598"><title>Rafting Rio Balsa half day class 2 &amp; 3 Arenal Volcano Tours Guanacaste Costa Rica</title><clippings><text_clipping text="      Challenge yourself as you paddle through fun &amp; safe rolling rapids with names like &#34;Morning Coffee&#34; &amp; &#34;Rock around the Croc&#34; and then play around in tranquil river pools in an isolated rainforest river canyon!
