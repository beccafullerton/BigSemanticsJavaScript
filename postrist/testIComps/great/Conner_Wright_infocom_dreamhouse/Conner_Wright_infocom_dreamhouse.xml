However, the brain consumes a large proportion of the body&#39;s calories at any one time and preservation of energy could only occur by limiting its sensory inputs. Another argument against the theory is that sleep is not simply a passive consequence of removing the animal from the environment, but is a &#34;drive&#34;; animals alter their behaviors in order to obtain sleep. Therefore, circadian regulation is more than sufficient to explain periods of activity and quiescence that are adaptive to an organism, but the more peculiar specializations of sleep probably serve different and unknown functions. Moreover, the preservation theory needs to explain why carnivores like lions, which are on top of the food chain and thus have little to fear, sleep the most.

The results showed that ten minutes after the trial RUN session, there was a 12% increase in the mean firing rate of hippocampal place cells from the PRE level; however, after 20 minutes, the mean firing rate returned rapidly toward the PRE level.

In many nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies, people will sleep on and off throughout the day or night depending on what is happening.[69] Plentiful artificial light has been available in the industrialized West since at least the mid-19th century, and sleep patterns have changed significantly everywhere that lighting has been introduced.[69] In general, people sleep in a more concentrated burst through the night, going to sleep much later, although this is not always true.[69] Historian Roger Ekrich thinks that the traditional pattern of &#34;segmented sleep&#34; as it is called began to disappear among the urban upper class in Europe in the late 17th century and the change spread over the next 200 years; by the 1920s &#34;the idea of a first and second sleep had receded entirely from our social consciousness.&#34;[71] Ekrich attributes the change to increases in &#34;street lighting, domestic lighting and a surge in coffee houses,&#34; which slowly made nighttime a legitimate time for activity, decreasing the time available for rest.[71]"><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="nomadic" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic" target_title="Nomadic"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="hunter-gatherer" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer" target_title="Hunter-gatherer"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="artificial light" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_light" target_title="Artificial light"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="segmented sleep" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmented_sleep" target_title="Segmented sleep"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="In some societies, people generally sleep with at least one other person (sometimes many) or with animals.

For example, people might only sleep with their immediate family, extended family, spouses, their children, children of a certain age, children of specific gender, peers of a certain gender, friends, peers of equal social rank, or with no one at all.
