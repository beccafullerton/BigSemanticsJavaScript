For simple geodesic domes, curves follow the surface of a sphere circumscribing a regular polyhedron with triangular faces, (tetrahedron, icosahedron, or octahedron). The desired frequency of the subsequent geodesic sphere or dome is the number of parts or segments into which a side (edge) of the underlying polyhedral triangle is subdivided. The frequency has historically been denoted by the Greek letter &#34;&#34; (nu).

The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves before and after the splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1&#160;dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire." text="Fusion splicing is done with a specialized instrument that typically operates as follows: The two cable ends are fastened inside a splice enclosure that will protect the splices, and the fiber ends are stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves before and after the splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss.

A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket.

A typical connector is installed by preparing the fiber end and inserting it into the rear of the connector body.

For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core.

Single-mode fibers are used for most communication links longer than 1,050 meters (3,440&#160;ft)."><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="transparent" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency" target_title="Transparency"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="core" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_(optical_fiber)" target_title="Core (optical fiber)"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="cladding" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladding_(fiber_optics)" target_title="Cladding (fiber optics)"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="index of refraction" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_refraction" target_title="Index of refraction"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="total internal reflection" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection" target_title="Total internal reflection"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="waveguide" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide_(optics)" target_title="Waveguide (optics)"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="transverse modes" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_mode" target_title="Transverse mode"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="multi-mode fibers" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mode_fiber" target_title="Multi-mode fiber"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="single-mode fibers" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-mode_fiber" target_title="Single-mode fiber"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="Joining lengths of optical fiber is more complex than joining electrical wire or cable.

John Tyndall included a demonstration of it in his public lectures in London, 12 years later.[3] Tyndall also wrote about the property of total internal reflection in an introductory book about the nature of light in 1870: &#34;When the light passes from air into water, the refracted ray is bent towards the perpendicular... When the ray passes from water to air it is bent from the perpendicular... If the angle which the ray in water encloses with the perpendicular to the surface be greater than 48 degrees, the ray will not quit the water at all: it will be totally reflected at the surface.... The angle which marks the limit where total reflection begins is called the limiting angle of the medium.

Modern optical fibers, where the glass fiber is coated with a transparent cladding to offer a more suitable refractive index, appeared later in the decade.[3] Development then focused on fiber bundles for image transmission. Harold Hopkins and Narinder Singh Kapany at Imperial College in London achieved low-loss light transmission through a 75 cm long bundle which combined several thousand fibers.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, light was guided through bent glass rods to illuminate body cavities.[10] Jun-ichi Nishizawa, a Japanese scientist at Tohoku University, also proposed the use of optical fibers for communications in 1963, as stated in his book published in 2004 in India.[11] Nishizawa invented other technologies that contributed to the development of optical fiber communications, such as the graded-index optical fiber as a channel for transmitting light from semiconductor lasers.[12][13] The first working fiber-optical data transmission system was demonstrated by German physicist Manfred B&#246;rner at Telefunken Research Labs in Ulm in 1965, which was followed by the first patent application for this technology in 1966 [14] [15]. Charles K. Kao and George A. Hockham of the British company Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) were the first to promote the idea that the attenuation in optical fibers could be reduced below 20 decibels per kilometer (dB/km), making fibers a practical communication medium.[16] They proposed that the attenuation in fibers available at the time was caused by impurities that could be removed, rather than by fundamental physical effects such as scattering. They correctly and systematically theorized the light-loss properties for optical fiber, and pointed out the right material to use for such fibers&#160;&#8212; silica glass with high purity.

Index of refraction is calculated by dividing the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed of light in some other medium. The index of refraction of a vacuum is therefore 1, by definition. The typical value for the cladding of an optical fiber is 1.52.[34] The core value is typically 1.62.[34] The larger the index of refraction, the slower light travels in that medium. From this information, a good rule of thumb is that signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200 million meters per second.

Thus a phone call carried by fiber between Sydney and New York, a 12000 kilometer distance, means that there is an absolute minimum delay of 60 milliseconds (or around 1/16 of a second) between when one caller speaks to when the other hears.

All the forces are resolved into compressive stresses. This is useful because several of the available building materials such as stone, cast iron and concrete can strongly resist compression but are very weak when tension, shear or torsional stress is applied to them. By using the arch configuration, significant spans can be achieved. This is because all the compressive forces hold it together in a state of equilibrium. This even applies to frictionless surfaces. However, one downside is that an arch pushes outward at the base, and this needs to be restrained in some way, either with heavy sides and friction or angled cuts into bedrock or similar."><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="tensile stresses" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensile_stress" target_title="Tensile stress"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="compressive stresses" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressive_stress" target_title="Compressive stress"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="stone" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)" target_title="Rock (geology)"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="cast iron" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron" target_title="Cast iron"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="concrete" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete" target_title="Concrete"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="tension" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensile_stress" target_title="Tensile stress"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="shear" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress" target_title="Shear stress"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="torsional" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(mechanics)" target_title="Torsion (mechanics)"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="This same principle holds when the force acting on the arch is not vertical such as in spanning a doorway, but horizontal, such as in arched retaining walls or dams."><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="force" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force" target_title="Force"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="retaining walls" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retaining_wall" target_title="Retaining wall"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="dams" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam" target_title="Dam"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="Even when using concrete, where the structure may be monolithic, the principle of the arch is used so as to benefit from the concrete&#39;s strength in resisting compressive stress.

The voussoirs are laid on it until the arch is complete and self-supporting. For an arch higher than head height, scaffolding would in any case be required by the builders, so the scaffolding can be combined with the arch support. Occasionally arches would fall down when the frame was removed if construction or planning had been incorrect.
