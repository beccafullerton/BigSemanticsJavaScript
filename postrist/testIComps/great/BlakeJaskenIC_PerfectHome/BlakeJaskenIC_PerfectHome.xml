Site selection was aimed at providing the cabin inhabitants with both sunlight and drainage to make them better able to cope with the rigors of frontier life. Proper site selection placed the home in a location best suited to manage the farm or ranch. When the first pioneers built cabins, they were able to &#34;cherry pick&#34; the best logs for cabins. These were old-growth trees with few limbs (knots) and straight with little taper. Such logs did not need to be hewn to fit well together. Careful notching minimized the size of the gap between the logs and reduced the amount of chinking (sticks or rocks) or daubing (mud) needed to fill the gap. The length of one log was generally the length of one wall, although this was not a limitation for most good cabin builders."></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="Decisions had to be made about the type of cabin. Styles varied greatly from one part of the US to another: the size of the cabin, the number of stories, type of roof, the orientation of doors and windows all needed to be taken into account when the cabin was designed. In addition, the source of the logs, the source of stone and available labor, either human or animal, had to be considered. If timber sources were further away from the site, the cabin size might be limited."></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="Cabin corners were often set on large stones; if the cabin was large, other stones were used at other points along the sill (bottom log). Since they were usually cut into the sill, thresholds were supported with rock as well. These stones are found below the corners of many 18th-century cabins as they are restored.

His father, William Carey Wright (1825&#8211;1904), was a locally admired orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister. William Wright had met and married Anna Lloyd Jones (1838/39 &#8211; 1923), a county school teacher, the previous year when he was employed as the superintendent of schools for Richland County. Originally from Massachusetts, William Wright had been a Baptist minister, but he later joined his wife&#39;s family in the Unitarian faith. Anna was a member of the large, prosperous and well-known Lloyd Jones family of Unitarians, who had emigrated from Wales to Spring Green, Wisconsin. One of Anna&#39;s brothers was Jenkin Lloyd Jones, who would become an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the Western United States. Both of Wright&#39;s parents were strong-willed individuals with idiosyncratic interests that they passed on to him. In his biography his mother declared, when she was expecting her first child, that he would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant&#39;s ambition. The family moved to Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1870 for William to minister a small congregation."><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Richland Center" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richland_Center,_Wisconsin" target_title="Richland Center, Wisconsin"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Richland County" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richland_County,_Wisconsin" target_title="Richland County, Wisconsin"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Massachusetts" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts" target_title="Massachusetts"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Baptist" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist" target_title="Baptist"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Unitarian" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarianism" target_title="Unitarianism"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Wales" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" target_title="Wales"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Jenkin Lloyd Jones" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkin_Lloyd_Jones" target_title="Jenkin Lloyd Jones"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Weymouth" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weymouth,_Massachusetts" target_title="Weymouth, Massachusetts"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="In 1876, Anna visited the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr&#246;bel.

Wright made one more request: &#34;Mr. Sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn&#39;t you lend me enough money to build a little house?&#34;[16] With Sullivan&#39;s $5000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of Oak Park. The existing Gothic Revival house was given to his mother, while a compact Shingle style house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.[17]"><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Catherine Lee &#34;Kitty&#34; Tobin" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Lee_Tobin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target_title="Catherine Lee Tobin (page does not exist)"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Oak Park" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Park,_Illinois" target_title="Oak Park, Illinois"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Gothic Revival" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_Revival" target_title="Gothic Revival"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Shingle style" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingle_style" target_title="Shingle style"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="According to an 1890 diagram of the firm&#39;s new, 17th floor space atop the Auditorium Building, Wright soon earned a private office next to Sullivan&#39;s own.[15] However, that office was actually shared with friend and draftsman George Elmslie, who was hired by Sullivan at Wright&#39;s request.[18] Wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office. As a general rule, Adler &amp; Sullivan did not design or build houses, but they obliged when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects. Wright was occupied by the firm&#39;s major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio. He would later claim total responsibility for the design of these houses, but careful inspection of their architectural style, and accounts from historian Robert Twombly suggest that it was Sullivan that dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; Wright&#39;s design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from Sullivan&#39;s sketches.[18] During this time, Wright worked on Sullivan&#39;s bungalow (1890) and the James A. Charnley Bungalow (1890) both in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, the Berry-MacHarg House (1891) and Sullivan&#39;s townhouse (1892) both in Chicago, and the most noted 1891 James A. Charnley House also in Chicago. Of the five collaborations, only the two commissions for the Charnley family still stand.[19][20]"><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Sullivan&#39;s bungalow" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Sullivan_Bungalow" target_title="Louis Sullivan Bungalow"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="James A.

To compound the problem, Wright&#39;s children &#8211; including first born Lloyd (b.1890) and John (b.1892) &#8211; would share similar tastes for fine goods.[16][21] To supplement his income and repay his debts, Wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses. These &#34;bootlegged&#34; houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable Queen Anne and Colonial Revival styles. Nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional cantilevers, and open floor plans which would become hallmarks of his later work. Eight of these early houses remain today including the Thomas Gale, Parker, Blossom, and Walter Gale houses.[22]"><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Lloyd" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Wright" target_title="Lloyd Wright"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="John" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lloyd_Wright" target_title="John Lloyd Wright"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Queen Anne" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Anne_Style_architecture_(United_States)" target_title="Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Colonial Revival" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture" target_title="Colonial Revival architecture"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="cantilevers" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantilever" target_title="Cantilever"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Thomas Gale" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_H._Gale_House" target_title="Thomas H.

Sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a Frank Lloyd Wright design. This particular house, built for Allison Harlan, was only blocks away from Sullivan&#39;s townhouse in the Chicago community of Kenwood. Aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony tracery in the same style as the Charnley House likely gave away Wright&#39;s involvement. Since Wright&#39;s five year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from Sullivan&#39;s firm.[20] A variety of stories recount the break in the relationship between Sullivan and Wright; even Wright later told two different versions of the occurrence. In An Autobiography, Wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract. When Sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue Wright the deed to his Oak Park house until after he completed his five years. Wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust. He &#34;threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the Adler and Sullivan office never to return.&#34; Dankmar Adler, who was more sympathetic to Wright&#39;s actions, later sent him the deed.[23] On the other hand, Wright told his Taliesin apprentices (as recorded by Edgar Tafel) that Sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the Harlan House. Tafel also accounted that Wright had Cecil Corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that Wright was aware of their illegal nature.[20][24] Regardless of the correct series of events, Wright and Sullivan did not meet or speak for twelve years."><anchors><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Allison Harlan" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allison_Harlan_House&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target_title="Allison Harlan House (page does not exist)"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Kenwood" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenwood,_Chicago" target_title="Kenwood, Chicago"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="tracery" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracery" target_title="Tracery"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="deed" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed" target_title="Deed"></wiki_anchor><wiki_anchor mm_name="anchors" anchor_text="Taliesin" link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliesin_(studio)" target_title="Taliesin (studio)"></wiki_anchor></anchors></paragraph><paragraph mm_name="paragraphs" paragraph_text="After leaving Louis Sullivan, Wright established his own practice on the top floor of the Sullivan designed Schiller Building (1892, demolished 1961) on Randolph Street in Chicago.

It was designed according to Wright&#39;s desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings, with a stream and waterfall running under part of the building. The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using limestone for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect&#39;s fee of $8,000. Kaufmann&#39;s own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done.

Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house&#39;s radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including sandwich walls that consisted of layers of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper, a significant change from typically framed walls.

These spaces in turn flowed into the main living areas, which also were characteristically outfitted with built-in seating and tables. As in the Prairie Houses, Usonian living areas focused on the fireplace. Bedrooms were typically isolated and relatively small, encouraging the family to gather in the main living areas. The conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the Prairie ideal; as the built-in furnishings related to the Arts and Crafts principles from which Wright&#39;s early works grew. Spatially and in terms of their construction, the Usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a Wright-designed house at relatively low cost. The diversity of the Usonian ideal can be seen in houses such as the Gregor S. and Elizabeth B. Affleck House (1941) in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, which projects over a ravine; and the Hanna-Honeycomb House (1937) in Palo Alto, California, which features a honeycomb planning grid. Gordon House, completed in 1963, was Wright&#39;s last Usonian design.

Working with the Foundation, Coleman selected an unbuilt design that was originally commissioned for Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Wieland and due to be built in Maryland, USA. However, the Wielands subsequently had financial problems and the design was shelved. The Foundation looked through its archive of 380 unbuilt designs and selected 4 for Coleman that were the closest fit for his site. In the end, he chose the Wieland house, largely because the topography of his site is virtually identical to that for which the building was originally designed. The completed house,[56] in only the fourth country in which a Wright design has been realized, is attracting broad interest from the international architectural community.

He was one of the first architects to design and supply custom-made, purpose-built furniture and fittings that functioned as integrated parts of the whole design, and he often returned to earlier commissions to redesign internal fittings. Some of the built-in furniture remains, while other restorations have included replacement pieces created using his plans. His Prairie houses use themed, coordinated design elements (often based on plant forms) that are repeated in windows, carpets and other fittings. He made innovative use of new building materials such as precast concrete blocks, glass bricks and zinc cames (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used Pyrex glass tubing as a major element in the Johnson Wax Headquarters.

Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds. One of Wright&#39;s earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls. By utilizing this large amount of glass, Wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls.
